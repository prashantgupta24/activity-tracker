The 'scripts' directory contains small programs that facilitate the development
of xgbutil.

Currently, there is only one script: 'write-events'.

write-events
============
write-events is a short Python program that can automatically generates two
Go source files in the 'xevent' package. Namely, the 'types_auto.go' and
'callbacks.go' files. Both files contain a lot of boiler plate related to
definitions of each X event in the core protocol.

If and when xgbutil adds support for other extensions (i.e., RandR), more
events will need to be added.

'write-events' is run in when calling 'make' in the xgbutil root directory.
