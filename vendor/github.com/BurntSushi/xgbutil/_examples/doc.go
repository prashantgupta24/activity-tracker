/*
Package examples contains several complete examples depicting some common use
cases of xgbutil.

The examples included are designed to either demonstrate how a particular
facility of xgbutil works, or how to accomplish some common goal when using X.

For example, example simple-keybinding demonstrates how to use xgbutil to
respond to particular key presses while example graceful-window-close shows
how to close windows without killing your connection to X.

My goal is that each example demonstrates one thing, although the nature of X
typically requires some amount of boilerplate so that some examples are a bit
more bloated than I would like.

If you have any suggestions for other examples to include, I'd be happy to hear
them. You may post them at the main project page:
